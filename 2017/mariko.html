    <p>This past November was my 10th anniversary in the tech industry. Last 3 years were spent in a job writing code. Last year, I called for running a blog advent calender - a collection of 25 articles by people who build on the web. This year, I've invited people whose work I admire and who impact my life in these 3 years at coding job. </p>
    <p>Each day, I'll write how I know them, link to their blog post - coding related or not, and share short answers from them on their work in 2017/2018.</p>
    <p>I'm starting this with my own post. 2017 was tough year. I went through roller coaster of emotions on many different occasions. I wanted to put a <em>coda</em> on one thing I've been thinking a lot. </p>
    <h2>Read the Post</h2>
    <p class="post_link"><a href="https://kosamari.com/notes/blur-the-line" title="">Blur the Line - On "tech" and "non-tech" discussion, and how it's a toxic lie.</a></p>
    <h2>Ask Mariko</h2>
    <h3>What is one tool you can't leave at home in order to do your work ?</h3>
      <p>Pen and Papers. I know it's so analog, but it works great.</p>

    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
      <p>Browser internals. How and what has to happen in order to display a web page.</p>

    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
      <p>I want to make <a href="https://twitter.com/kosamari/status/930558641706500097">a pseudo browser inside of a browser</a>.</p>
