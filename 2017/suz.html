    <h1>Suz Hinton</h1>
    <date>Dec 24nd, 2017</date>
    <p>Me and Suz instantly became friends when we met at BrooklynJS almost 2 years ago, and became more close friends when we went to Eyeo together. We've had many long weekend brunches - which, we seem to never run out of things to talk about. We've spoke and attended many conferences together.</p>
    <p>
    What I admire in Suz's work is focus and persistence. When she cares about something, she works on it and follow through. Attention to accessibility, not just in web apps she built but also in video she produced, is one I respect the most.
    </p>
    <p>She is as weird and obsessed as me, and I think that's why I like talking to her. When I have the most random ideas which some people might find "but why?", she is always there to nod and say "oh that sounds fun".</p>
    <p>Looks like she worked on a fun project using Docker and headless Chrome. Enjoy the post.</p>

    <h2>Ask Suz</h2>
    <h3>What is one tool you can't leave at home in order to do your work ?</h3>
    <p>Headphones, to either block out sound or to listen to music while I work.</p>
    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
      <p>How neural networks are built!</p>

    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
      <p>I want to improve my low level skills. I know some C / C++ but it's time I understood kernels and operating systems on a deeper level than I currently do now.</p>
