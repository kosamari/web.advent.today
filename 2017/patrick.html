    Patrick is someone who I don't know much about (yet!) but someone I would like to get to know more in 2018.
    </p>
    <p>We met in person this year in Fortaleza Brazil where we were both speaking at Brazil JS. I started the conversation (somewhat predictably) "Hey other browser person! nice to meet you." We talked about keeping web compatibility and browser bugs. Then, the conversation somehow morphed into knitting.</p>
    <p>
    Turns out, he is a fellow knitter! We bonded over the conversation about yarn stores and yarn made out of possum(!!). I hope our path cross again in 2018 and we get to have a knitting circle at some conference.

      Patrick wrote a post about Image Maps, covering the history & what's possible now. Enjoy!

    <h2>Ask Patrick</h2>
    <h3>What is one tool you can't leave at home in order to do your work ?</h3>
    <p>A sleepmask. I travel a lot for work (for meetups, conferences), and as a result I am regularly pretty jetlagged. In the begining I struggled with getting actual work done while travelling (wether it is speaking or just keeping up with my emails). I got a good sleepmask to help, and it is super weird to find out how much more productive I was after a good nights sleep. I use one to make sure I get enough rest to be of any use to anyone. I even use it at home now.</p>
    <p>As for dev tools, I would say jsbin. I use the site constantly for quick demo and to test out bugs in the browser. It is by far my most used dev site.</p>

    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
    <p>One of the things I dove into near the end of the year was WebBluetooth. After reading over the spec, I created <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/denladeside/status/922520050791202816" title="">a polyfill for Microsoft Edge</a>. Being able to control a number of my devices at home using just a browser is a <em>really</em> exciting advancement for the web platform. I can't wait to see how it develops in 2018. </p>
    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
    <p>I have a half dozen projects in various states of flux that I started in 2017 that I still haven't shipped. I hope to release some, if not all of them in 2018, and to just get better at finishing the projects I start.</p>
