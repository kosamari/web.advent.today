    <h1>Justin Falcone</h1>
    <date>Dec 23nd, 2017</date>
    <p>First time I met Jusin was at a meetup in Jersey City called JerseyScript. He talked about breakfast and obsession of making breakfast as a hipster living in Brooklyn. He then made breakfast, on screen, with SVG and React.</p>
    <p>I would say Justin is a performer, anthropologist, and historian. When he research a topic for his writing or talk, he seems to go down deep on research. He often goes out to find historical facts and influences. His talk is structured like a 3 Act stage show.</p>
    <p>I hope you enjoy this post from him, on FizzBuzz the brief history and how industry treats it.</p>

    <h2>Ask Justin</h2>
    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
      <p>The biggest change in the way I think about programming was a result of learning <a href="en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog" title="">Prolog</a> — it requires a radically different approach to solving problems, but that approach has stuck with me even in “normal” programming languages. </p>

    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
      <p>My main goal for 2018 is to get into the habit of releasing small projects on a regular schedule, and not try to make everything a Grand Statement.</p>
