    <h1>Dion Almaer</h1>
    <date>Dec 29th, 2017</date>
    <p>
      When Dion first messaged me to have a coffee and chat about developer relations, I thought Dion was a recruiter (He is now my manager's manager's manager, so definitely not a recruiter) . I asked around my friends who work at Google who he was. Turns out he was a long time web enthusiast and used to run popular blog Ajaxian. To my defense, I came to JavaScript Developer scene in 2013, so I totally missed the dev scene when Ajax was a thing.</p>
    <p>
      When I got an offer for Developer Relations team, I Internet stalked my potential coworkers and managers. I watched conference videos, read blog posts, and and scroll through tweets to see what that job is like. I discovered a talk from 10 years ago by Dion enthusiastically talking about Google Gears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gears was great promise - It's like Electron of 2000s. It let you write widgets on your desktop with web technology. As a young product manager in web application company, I remember being excited about possibility Gears will open up to our team.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slide from Dion's Google Gears presentation read like it's a slide for Service Workers and Progressive Web Apps we are talking now. Since he has clearly been thinking about this for long time, I asked Dion if he could write about a decade long path that got us here, and what to look for in 2018.

    <h2>Ask Dion</h2>
    <h3>What is one tool you can't leave at home in order to do your work ?</h3>
    <p>I am going to go with something a little different here. An addition that has been transformative for me is taking some control over the information that lives in my brain. After studying how the brain works, I went deep into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition" title="">spaced repetition</a>, which is a simple technique that allows you to spend a minimal amount of time to keep information available in memory. When paired with other techniques such as <a href="https://wac.colostate.edu/intro/pop2d.cfm" title="">write to learn</a>, and “just doing it” I can learn so much more.</p>


    <p>For coding, you can checkout tools such as <a href="https://enki.com/" title="">Enki</a>, for a 5 minute curated dev “workout”, and <a href="https://ankiweb.net/about" title="">Anki</a> to store your own. Also, I love how courses such as Dave’s <a href="https://geddski.teachable.com/p/gridcritters" title="">CSS Grid Critters</a> uses repetition baked in.</p>

    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
    <p>I won’t mince words, 2017 was challenging for me. I had to come to the realization that I need to focus on my sphere of control, as the constant consumption of news really got to my psyche. My biggest TIL moment was understanding that I needed to hold things more lightly and switch to areas where I could *do* to make the world a better place.</p>
    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
      <p>I want to get back to basics. We have so many fancy books and modern “do this to get more done!” techniques, and this is all useful, but I think that at the meta level it kinda comes down to: <b>plan the work, and work the plan</b>.</p>
