    <h1>Tracy Hinds</h1>
    <date>Dec 26th, 2017</date>
    <p>
      Tracy is a community grower. When I first met Tracy, she was juggling to organize 2 conferences while moving across the country, and while having full time job as an engineer. I'm pretty sure anyone who knows Tracy at least once wondered how the heck she does it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tracy puts whole a lot of extra care to community she organize. The thing amaze me the most is that she builds a team around each community. You might have been to an event that are dominantly run by one person - the kind of event everyone call "[person]'s conference" rather than the event name itself. That kind of event goes away once the organizer gets busy, and community gets left behind. She structures her community organizing in the way that community can keep going regardless of the level of her involvement.
    </p>
    <p>She put whole a lot pf practical information on how she does it all in this post. If you are interested in organizing and needs more guidance than "Make it how you like it and people will come", then this post is a must read.</p>
    <p>
      By the way, she bakes great cookies.

    <h2>Read the Post</h2>

    <h2>Ask Tracy</h2>
    <h3>What is one tool you can't leave at home in order to do your work ?</h3>
    <p>My work notebook + favorite pen to take copious notes for my tracking thought process, problem solving, and overall productivity.</p>
    <h3>What did you learn in 2017 ?</h3>
    <p>I will never be content until I dive head first into doing things I know I can do and am an expert in. </p><p>Most folks won't ask you to do these things, they are waiting for you to lead the charge. If you are a calculated-risk person, asking for permission is pretty silly when you've already mitigated for the risks and are knowledgeable to achieve an outcome.</p>

    <h3>What do you want to learn/work on/improve in 2018?</h3>
      <p>Ask for permission less.</p>
